# Deep Learning Examples

This is a Collection of Deep learning Examples written in Javascript, Quasar, and Vue.js

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Quasar CLI

```
npm install --save quasar-cli -g
```

Vue CLI

```
npm install --save vue-cli -g
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Change directory into the project folder and install Prerequisites

```
cd /path/to/project
npm install
```

Run a local Dev Server with Hot Reload

```
quasar dev
```

This will open the application in your default browser and automatically rebuild and refresh the page anytime the local code changes.

## Deployment

To build for production run;

```
quasar clean
quasar build
```

## Built With

* [Quasar-Framework](https://quasar-framework.org) - File templating, app processing, and just general goodness.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) - Glorious Semantic Front End Framework
* [Synaptic.js](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) - Used to generate and train Neural Networks
* [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) - Used to generate and train Neural Networks

## Acknowledgments

* Razvan Stoenescu for making Quasar Framework which is by and large the most amazingly useful technology in my toolbelt other than Vue.js
* Speaking of Vue.js Evan Yu for making Vue.js the most semantic, easy to use, and overall lovely front end framework available.
* The Authors of Synaptic.js and Brain.js for making some wonderful deep learning libraries
